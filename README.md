# ASFShortcut

A HarmonyOS client for [ArchiSteamFarm](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm) (ASF).

Send custom commands to ASF and view the results directly.

## How It Works

The app communicates with your ASF instance by sending POST requests to its `/Api/Command` endpoint.

_Only tested on Mate 60 Pro._
